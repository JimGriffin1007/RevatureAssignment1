1.
	(a) JDK: "Java Developement Kit"
	    - Software development environment used for developing Java 			applications. Contains tools such as the JRE, an interpreter, a 		compiler, and an archiver.
	(b) JRE: "Java Runtime Environment"
		- Contains the Java class libraries, the Java class loader, and 		and the Java Virtual Machine.
	(c) JVM: "Java Virtual Machine"
		- Responsible for ensuring Java applications have the resources 		they need to run and perform well. Virtual platform that 
		resides on your RAM

2. The JVM is an INTERPRETER.

3. Java uses references to objects instead of pointers which suites the needs of OOP. The absence of pointers in Java also improves security and robustness. 

4. Class loaders:
	(a) Bootstrap: rt.jar
	(b) Extension 
	(c) Application/System

5. Classes are loaded by the JVM ONLY WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED.

6. Static and Instance variables are stored in in PermGen region of HEAP memory.

7. PermGen memory space is a special heap space separated from the main memory heap.

8. Metaspace is a new memory space which has replaced PermGen as of Java 8. It handles memory allocation differently by allowing it to grow automatically by default. 

9. When an object is created in Java, memory is allocated first, then fields are initialized to their default values, and then constructor method invocation.

10. Types of memory used by JVM: Heap, Method area, Stack area.

11. Java passes objects/object references by REFERENCE, but passes method arguments by VALUE. Java uses both. 

12. A native method is a Java method whose implementation is written in another programming language such as C.
